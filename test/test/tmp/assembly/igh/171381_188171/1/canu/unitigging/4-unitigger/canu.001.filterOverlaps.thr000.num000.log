BEST EDGE FILTERING
-------------------

Reads with both best edges below threshold:        18
Reads with one  best edge  above threshold:         2
Reads with both best edges above threshold:         0


INITIAL EDGES
-------- ----------------------------------------
      14 reads are contained
       0 reads have no best edges (singleton)
       9 reads have only one best edge (spur) 
                3 are mutual best
      11 reads have two best edges 
                1 have one mutual best edge
               10 have two mutual best edges


EDGE FILTERING
-------- ------------------------------------------
       0 reads are ignored
       0 reads have a gap in overlap coverage
       3 reads have lopsided best edges

FINAL EDGES
-------- ----------------------------------------
      14 reads are contained
       3 reads have no best edges (singleton)
       6 reads have only one best edge (spur) 
                2 are mutual best
      11 reads have two best edges 
                0 have one mutual best edge
               11 have two mutual best edges
